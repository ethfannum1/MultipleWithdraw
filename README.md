This is an easy smart contract to withdraw funds to some ETH addresses.

Each address will receive an amount.

And the sum of all amounts has to be same amount than the value sent to the contract.

Take a look to the smart contract code in *MultipleWithdraw.sol*
and in the next images.



------------


First of all we deploy the contract:

First address is for deploy and execution.
Next 3 addresses are the ones selected to work with.

Send 99 weis to the contract.
And write down 3 addresses and 3 amounts.

After pressing the Transact button, the contract executes fine,
and the 3 addresses get their respective funds.
